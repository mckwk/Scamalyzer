# Scamalyzer (iOS Branch)

This branch is dedicated to building and running Scamalyzer as an iOS app using Capacitor.

Scamalyzer analyzes text messages (SMS, emails, etc.) for signs of deception and fraud, using advanced machine learning (BERT-based models) to classify messages as safe or fraudulent. This branch contains only the frontend code and iOS project setup. The backend and database are not included here; the app is intended to connect to a remote backend API.

## Project Structure

- **frontend/**: React client, configured with Capacitor for iOS.
  - **ios/**: iOS project generated by Capacitor (`npx cap add ios`)
- **capacitor.config.ts**: Capacitor configuration file.
- **build/**: Production build output for the React app.

## iOS App Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install npm dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the React app:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
4. If not already done, install Capacitor:
   ```
   npm install --save @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
   ```
5. Initialize Capacitor (if not done):
   ```
   npx cap init
   ```
   - App name: Scamalyzer
   - App ID: com.example.scamalyzer
   - Web directory: build
6. Add iOS platform (if not done):
   ```
   npx cap add ios
   ```
7. Sync your project:
   ```
   npx cap sync
   ```
8. Open the iOS project in Xcode:
   ```
   npx cap open ios
   ```
9. Build and run the app on a simulator or device from Xcode.

## Notes

- Any time you update the React app, run `npm run build` and `npx cap sync` to update the iOS project.
- The `ios/` folder contains the native iOS project. Commit this folder to GitHub to store your iOS app.
- You can use Capacitor plugins for native features if needed.

## Usage

Once the iOS app is built and installed on your device/emulator, you can use the mobile interface to input messages for analysis. The app will classify messages and provide feedback on their safety. Make sure your app is configured to connect to the correct backend API endpoint.

## Storing the iOS Project on GitHub

To store your iOS project on GitHub:

1. Make sure the `ios/` folder is present in your `frontend` directory.
2. Add all files to git:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add iOS project with Capacitor"
   ```
3. Push to your GitHub repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   git push -u origin ios
   ```
   Replace `<your-username>` and `<repo-name>` as appropriate.
