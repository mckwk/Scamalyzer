# Scamalyzer (Android Branch)

**This branch is dedicated to building and running Scamalyzer as an Android app using Capacitor.**

Scamalyzer analyzes text messages (SMS, emails, etc.) for signs of deception and fraud, using advanced machine learning (BERT-based models) to classify messages as safe or fraudulent. This branch contains only the frontend code and Android project setup. The backend and database are not included here; the app is intended to connect to a remote backend API.



## Project Structure

- **frontend/**: React client, configured with Capacitor for Android.
   - **android/**: Android project generated by Capacitor (`npx cap add android`).
   - **capacitor.config.ts**: Capacitor configuration file.
   - **build/**: Production build output for the React app.



## Android App Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install npm dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the React app:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
4. If not already done, install Capacitor:
   ```
   npm install --save @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
   ```
5. Initialize Capacitor (if not done):
   ```
   npx cap init
   ```
   - App name: Scamalyzer
   - App ID: com.example.scamalyzer
   - Web directory: `build`
6. Add Android platform (if not done):
   ```
   npx cap add android
   ```
7. Sync your project:
   ```
   npx cap sync
   ```
8. Open the Android project in Android Studio:
   ```
   npx cap open android
   ```
9. Build and run the app on an emulator or device from Android Studio.

#### Notes
- Any time you update the React app, run `npm run build` and `npx cap sync` to update the Android project.
- The `android/` folder contains the native Android project. Commit this folder to GitHub to store your Android app.
- You can use Capacitor plugins for native features if needed.



## Usage

Once the Android app is built and installed on your device/emulator, you can use the mobile interface to input messages for analysis. The app will classify messages and provide feedback on their safety. Make sure your app is configured to connect to the correct backend API endpoint.


## Storing the Android Project on GitHub

To store your Android project on GitHub:
1. Make sure the `android/` folder is present in your `frontend` directory.
2. Add all files to git:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Android project with Capacitor"
   ```
3. Push to your GitHub repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   git push -u origin android
   ```
   Replace `<your-username>` and `<repo-name>` as appropriate.
